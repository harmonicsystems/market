## A Kinderhook Tradition

"My family has been in Kinderhook since the 1800s—we're Dutch through and through. This puffy pancake was a Sunday morning staple in my grandmother's kitchen. She'd send us kids to the market for eggs and whatever berries were in season. Now I take my grandchildren to the same market, and we still make this together. The name 'Kinderhook' means 'children's corner' in Dutch, you know. This recipe feels like it belongs here."

## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs (farm fresh from the market!)
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 4 tablespoons butter
- Powdered sugar for dusting
- Fresh market berries
- Local maple syrup

## Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Set oven to 425°F. Place a 12-inch cast iron skillet in the oven to heat.

2. **Make batter**: Whisk eggs until frothy. Add milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Whisk until smooth—a few small lumps are fine.

3. **Heat the pan**: Carefully remove hot skillet from oven. Add butter and swirl until melted and coating the bottom and sides.

4. **Pour and bake**: Immediately pour batter into hot, buttered skillet. Return to oven.

5. **Bake**: 20 minutes until puffed and golden. Don't open the oven door while it bakes!

6. **Serve immediately**: The pancake will deflate as it cools (that's normal!). Dust with powdered sugar, pile on fresh berries, and drizzle with maple syrup.

## Dutch Heritage Notes

Kinderhook's Dutch roots run deep—Martin Van Buren, our 8th President, was born here and spoke Dutch as his first language. This style of pancake, sometimes called a "Dutch Baby" or "German Pancake," would have been familiar to the early Dutch settlers of the Hudson Valley.

## Seasonal Variations

- **Spring**: Sliced strawberries and rhubarb compote
- **Summer**: Fresh blueberries, raspberries, and peaches
- **Fall**: Sautéed apples with cinnamon (try Samascott's!)
