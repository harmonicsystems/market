A bright, fresh salad that celebrates the best of spring at the farmers market. Tender asparagus, peppery radishes, and fresh greens come together with a simple lemon vinaigrette.

## Ingredients

### For the Salad
- 1 bunch fresh asparagus (about 1 lb), trimmed
- 4 cups mixed spring greens
- 6-8 radishes, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds

### For the Lemon Vinaigrette
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 small clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the asparagus:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook for 2-3 minutes until bright green and crisp-tender. Immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking. Drain well and pat dry.

2. **Make the vinaigrette:** In a small jar, combine olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, and Dijon mustard. Shake vigorously until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Assemble the salad:** Arrange spring greens on a serving platter. Cut asparagus spears in half on the diagonal and scatter over greens. Add sliced radishes.

4. **Finish:** Drizzle with lemon vinaigrette and toss gently. Top with shaved Parmesan and toasted nuts. Serve immediately.

## Tips

- Look for asparagus with tight, compact tips and firm stalks
- The asparagus can be served warm or at room temperature
- Add a soft-boiled egg for extra protein
- Substitute goat cheese for a tangier flavor

## From the Market

Pick up fresh asparagus, radishes, and spring greens from our produce vendors. Local honey makes a lovely addition to the vinaigrette if you prefer a touch of sweetness!
