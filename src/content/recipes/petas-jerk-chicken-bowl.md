## From Peta's Kitchen

"When I'm at the Kinderhook market, I love walking around before we open and seeing what the other vendors have. I'll grab peppers from one stand, greens from another, tomatoes if they're ripe. Then I build my bowls around what's fresh that day. That's real Caribbean cooking—you work with what the land gives you."

## Ingredients

### For the Jerk Marinade
- 4 scallions, roughly chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper (remove seeds for less heat)
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Bowls
- 2 lbs boneless chicken thighs
- 2 cups rice (white or coconut rice)
- Fresh market greens
- 2 ripe tomatoes, diced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- Pickled onions (optional)
- Lime wedges

## Instructions

1. **Make marinade**: Blend all marinade ingredients until smooth. It should be thick like a paste.

2. **Marinate chicken**: Coat chicken thoroughly with jerk paste. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, overnight is better.

3. **Cook rice**: Prepare rice according to package directions. For coconut rice, substitute half the water with coconut milk.

4. **Grill chicken**: Preheat grill to medium-high. Grill chicken 6-7 minutes per side until cooked through and slightly charred. Let rest 5 minutes, then slice.

5. **Build bowls**: Start with rice, add greens, top with sliced chicken, tomatoes, peppers, and pickled onions. Squeeze lime over everything.

## Tips from Peta

- No grill? Use a cast iron skillet—get it smoking hot for that char
- The marinade also works beautifully on pork or firm fish
- Make extra marinade and keep it in the fridge for up to a week
- Find me at the market for the real deal—I'll be the one with the smoke and the music!
