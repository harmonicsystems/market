## A Note from Dave

"My grandfather always said the secret to good cooking is good ingredients. When you've got fresh carrots from the market and real wildflower honey, you don't need to do much to make something special. This is the dish that convinced my kids to eat their vegetables."

## Ingredients

- 1 lb fresh carrots from the market (rainbow carrots are beautiful here)
- 3 tablespoons Grandaddy Weaves wildflower honey
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- Fresh thyme sprigs
- Cracked black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prep the carrots**: Scrub carrots well (no need to peel market-fresh ones). Cut on a diagonal into 1/2-inch pieces for even cooking.

2. **Start cooking**: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and salt, toss to coat.

3. **Cover and steam**: Add 2 tablespoons water, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Glaze**: Remove lid, add honey and thyme. Increase heat to medium-high and cook 5-8 minutes, stirring frequently, until carrots are tender and glazed.

5. **Finish**: Season with pepper and a few fresh thyme leaves. Serve warm.

## Tips

- The honey will caramelize quickly at the end—watch carefully!
- Try this with other root vegetables: parsnips, turnips, or beets
- Leftover glazed carrots are delicious cold on a salad
