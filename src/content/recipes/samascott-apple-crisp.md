## From the Orchard

"We've been growing apples in the Hudson Valley for generations. This crisp recipe has been in our family for decades—it's what we make every fall when the Cortlands and Macouns come in. The secret is mixing apple varieties: some that hold their shape, some that break down into sauce. That's what gives you the perfect texture."

## Ingredients

### For the Filling
- 3 lbs mixed apples (we recommend Cortland, Macoun, and Honeycrisp)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- Juice of half a lemon

### For the Topping
- 1 cup old-fashioned oats
- 3/4 cup flour
- 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter, cubed

## Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 350°F. Butter a 9x13 baking dish.

2. **Prepare apples**: Peel, core, and slice apples about 1/4-inch thick. Toss with sugar, flour, spices, and lemon juice. Spread in prepared dish.

3. **Make topping**: Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cut in cold butter with your fingers or a pastry cutter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces.

4. **Assemble**: Scatter topping evenly over apples. Don't pack it down—you want it loose and crumbly.

5. **Bake**: 45 minutes until topping is golden and filling bubbles at the edges.

6. **Rest**: Let cool 10 minutes before serving. (If you can wait that long!)

## Serving Suggestions

- Warm with vanilla ice cream (the classic)
- With fresh whipped cream
- For breakfast with Greek yogurt (we won't tell)

## Apple Picking Tips

Visit us at the market in September and October for peak apple season. Ask us which varieties are best for baking that week—it changes as the season progresses!
