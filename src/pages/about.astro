        <h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-black mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-black/70 mb-4">
          The Kinderhook Farmers Market is a welcoming space where individuals and families meet and participate in community events while accessing fresh local food, handmade goods, and more. It is one of the oldest farmers markets in Columbia County, operating in Kinderhook's historic Village Square for more than two decades.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black/70 mb-4">
          Over the years, the market has played a key role in strengthening the local agricultural economy by providing an affordable outlet for small family farmers and food producers to expand their customer base. Vendors come from within a 50-mile radius of Kinderhook, and one of the hallmarks of the market is the commitment of our family of farmers to environmentally responsible farming practices.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black/70">
          The market also plays a central role in the village's overall economy by providing a seasonal destination for both residents and visitors. Market goers are invited to discover not only what market vendors have to offer but also the goods and services of the village's shops, galleries, recreational sites, and historic assets.

        </div>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-4">
          Kinderhook holds a unique place in American history as the birthplace and home of Martin Van Buren, the 8th President of the United States. Van Buren was known by the nickname "Old Kinderhook," which supporters abbreviated to "OK" during his 1840 presidential campaign.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/90 mb-4">
          "OK Clubs" sprang up across the country, and the phrase "OK" entered the American lexicon. While linguists debate the exact origins of "okay," many believe our little village played a significant role in popularizing one of the most widely used words in the English language.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/70 text-sm">
          So when you visit Kinderhook—it really is OK!

      <!-- Dutch Heritage -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-md p-6 md:p-8 mb-8">
        <h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-black mb-4">Dutch Heritage</h2>
        <p class="text-black/70 mb-4">
          The name "Kinderhook" comes from the Dutch "Kinderhoek," meaning "children's corner." The village was settled by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, and that heritage is still visible today in the architecture, place names, and community character.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black/70">
          The rolling farmland of Columbia County has been cultivated for over 300 years, and our farmers' market continues a tradition of agricultural commerce that stretches back to the earliest days of European settlement in the Hudson Valley.
